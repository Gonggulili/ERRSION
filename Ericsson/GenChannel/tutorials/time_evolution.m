%% Time Evolution and Scenario Transitions
%
% This tutorial shows how user trajectories, segments, and scenarios are
% defined. Channel coefficients are created for each segment separately.
% The channel merger combines these output into a longer sequence. The
% output sequences are evaluated for different settings of the model.
%
% The channel model generates the coefficients separately for each segment.
% In order to get a time-continuous output, these coefficients have to be
% combined. This is a feature which is originally described in the
% documentation of the WIM2 channel model, but which was never implemented.
% Since this component is needed for time-continuous simulations, it was
% implemented here. This script sets up the simulation and creates such
% time-continuous CIRs.

%% Channel model setup and coefficient generation
% First, we set up the channel model.

% Second, we create a more complex network layout featuring an elevated
% transmitter (25 m) and two receivers at 1.5 m height. The first Rx moves
% along a circular track around the receiver. The second receiver moves
% away from the Tx. Both start at the same point.
%
% Note here, that each track is split into three segments. The first Rx
% goes from an LOS area to a shaded area and back. The second
% track also start in the LOS area. Here, the scenario changes to another
% LOS segment and then to an NLOS segment. The LOS-LOS change will create
% new small-scale fading parameters, but the large scale parameters (LSPs)
% will be highly correlated between those two segments.

% guarantees repeatable results (i.e. the taps will be at the same
% positions for both runs). Also note the significantly longer computing

% drifting.

% When drifting is enabled (blue curve), the channel output after merging
% is time-continuous. The variations along the track come from the drifting
% K-Factor and the drifting shadow fading. When drifting is disabled, these
% parameters are not updated and kept fixed at their initial value.
%
% At the and of each segment, both channels are cross-faded. I.e. the power
% of the output of the first segment ramps down and the power of the second
% segment ramps up. Since drifting guarantees a time-continuous evolution
% of the phase, this ramping process is also time continuous and no
% artifacts are visible in the blue curve.
%
% Without drifting, however, the phases are approximated based on their
% initial values, the initial arrival- and departure angles and the
% traveled distance from the start point. However, since the Rx moves along
% a circular track, the angles change continuously which is not correctly
% modeled. The phase at the end of the first segment does not match the
% phase at the beginning of the second. When adding both components,
% artifacts appear as can be seen in the red curve.
%
% Next, we plot the power-delay profiles for both tracks. We calculate the
% frequency response of the channel and transform it back to time domain by
% an IFFT. Then, we create a 2D image of the received power at each
% position of the track. We start with the circular track.

% The X-axis shows the delay in microseconds and the Y-axis shows the
% position on the circle. For easier navigation, the position is given in
% degrees. 0째 means east (starting point), 90째 means north, 180째 west and
% 270째 south. The LOS delay stays constant since the distance to the Tx is
% also constant. However, the power of the LOS changes according to the
% scenario. Also note, that the NLOS segment has significantly more taps
% due to the longer delay spread.      
%
% Next, we create the same plot for the linear track. Note the slight
% increase in the LOS delay and the high similarity of the first two LOS
% segments due to the correlated LSPs. Segment change is at around 6 m.
